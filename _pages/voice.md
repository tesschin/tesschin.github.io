### **Research Goal**
* The primary objective of this paper is to further deepen our understanding on effective responses of CAs in relation to verbal abuse by examining alternative empathy styles.<br>
* We examine whether alternative forms of empathy orientation (other-oriented, self-oriented) and emotional expressivity (no facial expression, fixed facial expression, varied facial expression)
of voice-activated virtual assistants have different influences on users’ moral emotions found to reduce aggressive behaviors as well as whether they affect users’ perceptions of the agent’s capability.<br>

### **Methods**
* We conducted a lab experiment involving ninety-eight participants and ten alternative forms of CAs, each of which implemented a different response style against verbal abuse.<br>
* Ninety eight participants were assigned to one of the three emotional expressivity conditions (no-facial expression, fixed-facial expression, varied-facial expression) and interacted
with two alternative empathy orientation conditions (other-oriented, self-oriented) of agents.<br>

### **Results**
* The study results clearly show that other-oriented empathy response style is the most effective in positively influencing the user’s moral emotions tied to reducing the abusive behaviors as well as the perceptions regarding the agent’s capabilities.<br> 
* In contrast, the agent’s emotional expressivity implemented through facial expressions had no signicant effect on the study outcomes.<br>
* Users valued the agent’s verbal contents and vocal characteristics over the agent’s facial expressions.<br> 
* Participants showed a desire to interact with the agent that can have its emotion well reflected in various vocal features.<br>
